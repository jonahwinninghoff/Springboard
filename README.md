## Overview

The repository consists of mini-projects and three capstone projects for Springboard Data Science Career Plus, which provides necessary trainings with mentorship support for my professional career development. As indicated by above, there are several folders that contain a variety of Jupyter notebooks, problem worksheets, and architecture decision records, to name a few. 

## List To Do

**PRIMARY GOALS**

[X] Train a linear regression on your existing data

[X] Evaluate the linear regression model accuracy and be able to discuss with me how well or poorly you think it would work in the real world

STRETCH GOALS

[X] add the country categorical feature to your model

[X] retrain your model

[X] evaluate the new model and compare to the previous one

**NEXT WEEK**

[X] find information about the latitude and longitude for each country + year pair in your dataset

[X] some countries may appear and disappear over time and you may not be able to find a lat/lon pair for all of your dataset rows. this will give us an opportunity to do some data cleaning and deal with missing data (isna() and fillna())

[ ] find 2 more datasets unrelated to this dataset and write 2 more brief descriptions of these datasets and short proposals for 2 projects, these data descriptions and proposals can be similar to the Jupyter notebook you composed after our first call, with the addition of information about how to acquire the data (urls to the data)

**WEEK AFTER NEXT**

[ ] we can talk about all your proposals and data wrangling experience and decide on a path for capstone 2, the self-directed capstone
